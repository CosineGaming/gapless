the idea is about like, getting over passing and becomming whoever you are

it's kinda a Frozen story? or HULK? idk

so you've got starting with the moment you realize it's not ok to have your
power

and the power is becoming someone else for sure
the thing you become has nto be ugly and powerful and beautiful in a way

you can always do the thing!! that's critical
so like for 2 levels or so you actually can't
and then for the remaining levels it displays like you can't but you can
and then the last level you HAVE to. in order to advance. and you have to see
the intro which suggests that each time. kinda like in MGS

what's the actual story here? right like let's figure that out

IM INSPIRED BY SITCOMS
where's the sitcom in this story
obviously you have teh intense, and more meaningful parts of things
sitcom - so you have to devolp the characters?

so you've got [based on me] : LETO, they/them (hidden, forgotten)
and [based on hayley] : SHALEV, she/her (calm, tranquil)

LETO is clueless, headstrong, and unsympatethic. was wealthy but cut off family
SHALEV is completely fucking Deadpan. think garnet-like. calm + funny as shit.
constantly making fun of LETO. poor

WHAT ARE THEY TRYING TO DO????
THERE IS A MAGICAL CHINCHILLA (the CHINCHILLA OF POWER) in the heart of the
CAVES OF ELPIDIUS (hope)
LETO is looking for a way to become normal. and remove their magic and powers
SHALEV is looking to find a way to survive independently in the world

HOW DO THEY KNOW EACH OTHER
SHALEV is banished from their home. when visiting an Inn, aimlessly looking
for work or home
LETO storms in and interrogates the receptionist asking if they know of where
the CAVES are. the receptionist doesn't know but SHALEV knows of the tale from
as a kid
SHALEV asks LETO what's going on and it all goes from there

EXPOSITION OF LETO's ~SITUATION~
SHALEV wants to know why LETO is so obsessed with the CAVES. LETO hesitantly
tells the whole story, which will be animated by the game. this flashbacks
repeatedly


AT SOME POINT
LETO and SHALEV find a way OUT OF THE CAVES before finding the CHINCHILLA.
they're both faced with the decision to leave and quit and survive. THEY DECIDE
TO GO. they're deshevelled and weak. but as they leave they find THE WILDERNESS
IS JUST AS DANGEROUS and they go back into the caves to get the chinchilla.
LETO tries to leave on their own, but SHALEV catches them and reminds them of
their goals. LETO suggests they work together to close the hole, trapping them
both inside

POSSIBLE NAMES
LETO AND SHALEV
GAPLESS
THE CHINCHILLA OF ELPIDIUS
INTO ELPIDIUS

YOU GOTTA CHOOSE SOME KINDA AESTHETIC / ERA / WORLD MOOD
im thinking it's semi fantasy / medieval? but also modern? like modern
language but without the cheeky "modern tech" bullshit. but not steampunk

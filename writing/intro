INT. ASIER INN - LOBBY

SHALEV is sipping coffee in the lobby. LETO rushes in the door and goes up
to the RECEPTIONIST

LETO

RECEPTIONIST
caves of elephants? honey they're too BIG for caves. you're looking for
the SAVANNAH

LETO
don't call me honey. ELPIDIUS. you know, with the CHINCHILLA

RECEPTIONIST
you don't really believe in those childrens tales do you?

SHALEV
a good tale is rooted in truth

LETO
who are you?

SHALEV
SHALEV, pleasure to meet you. in KAUKONIA where i come from we say the caves
were created in CHILE to get out of the SUN during the long HOT SUMMER DAYS

LETO
CHILE? and to think i was traveling NORTH. im LETO by the way. appreciate
the help

LETO turns to leave.

SHALEV
wait a second LETO. ELPIDIUS and the CHINCHILLA OF POWER was my favourite tale
as a kid. Don't you think you could use a guide?
